# sneakers-app
## What is it about?
I've created this app for keeping a diary of the premieres of new limited shoes. The application has to allow adding, removing, displaying and modifying data (CRUD) both at the backend and frontend. Communication takes place through REST API and data is fully validated in a reactive form and backend.
## To create the project Iâ€™ve used:
- Spring (Lombok, Spring Data, Rest API)
- Angular
- Angular Material
- PostgreSQL
